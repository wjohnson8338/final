            <h1>Hi, I'm Will!</h1>
            <p>I'm a student of <a href="https://www.endicott.edu/" target="_blank">Endicott College</a> working my way towards a B.S in Computer Science! When I was a child, I loved experimenting with computers and testing to see what can be done with them. Over time, this has greatly improved my computer proficiency. Today, I am learning all sorts of new algorithms and honing my programming languages. For my areas of work, I like to focus on games, automation, and any other experiments I find interesting.</p>
            <h1>Involvements</h1>
            <p>I find it very important to be involved in my community. I am a member of Endicott Observer as a Photographer, you could see some of my work from this <a href="http://www.endicottobserver.com/multimedia/endicotts-2023-spring-week-regatta/collection_e2687340-df96-11ed-ba07-177c2b1b6f74.html" target="_blank">article</a>! I like to have a balance between technology and the arts, therefore I am also a member of Endicott Singers. I've volunteered for my College's accepted students day, and took part in representing the computer science department that day. Recently, I have been accepted into Endicott's Leadership Honors Program. This isn't the end! I wish to be a peer tutor for computer science and be apart of the Alpha Alpha Alpha &#40;Tri-Alpha&#41;</p>
            <h1>Skills / Experience</h1>
            <p>My Computer Proficiency, from file management, to computer structure, is top notch! During my time in college, I have become proficient in programming languages such as Python, HTML, and CSS. I know Javascript but have yet to master it. In the future, I wish to pick up some of the 'C' languages and learn Java or Lua. Extra non-essential skills I have is photography, minor graphic design. I also like to sing, as well as play both the guitar and piano.</p>
